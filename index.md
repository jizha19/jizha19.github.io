<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

<justify>I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at [Shanghai Jiao Tong Uiversity](https://www.sjtu.cn/) after six years research stay at [Université Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/en). I have strong interest in the field of polymer physics such as rheology, mechanical fatigue/fracture of nanocomposites, biobased and recycled polymers, and fluid dynamics. Throughout my academic and journey, I have demonstrated a passion for understanding the fundamental behavior of complex materials and have made my contributions to the field through the research. I have extensive experience in characterizing the mechanical and rheological properties of polymers, as well as investigating the effects of mechanical fatigue/fracture, rheology on these materials. Additionally, I have a keen interest in the fluid dynamics in polymeric products fabrication and have conducted research on the behavior of fluids in these complex environments. With a commitment to excellence in research and a dedication to advancing the field of polymer science, I can be a valuable asset to the team or project.</justify>
